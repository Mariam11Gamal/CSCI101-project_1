        <p> I’m 18 and studying computer science at Nile University. I’ve lived in 6 October City my whole life, so it really feels like home.
            I’m a big-time gamer—honestly, gaming is what got me hooked on tech and programming. At Nile University,
            I’m part of some awesome clubs like Legends, ICPC, and Trojan.
            It’s been great to push myself, work on projects, and hang out with people who are just as into coding and challenges as I am. <br>
